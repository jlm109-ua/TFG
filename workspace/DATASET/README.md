# check_directories.sh

This little program was made with one objective in mind: check what kernels were left to convert. It's a simple program that checks the subdirectories in each c and c++ directories and prints those that aren't in the other directory.

You can execute it with:
```
$ sudo sh check_directories.sh
```

# c

This directory contains almost all the c versions of the programs from https://github.com/HPCCS/Computation-Kernel-Dataset. Some of them may not work.

# c++

We got all the c++ kernels from https://github.com/HPCCS/Computation-Kernel-Dataset. None of these were made by Juan Llinares Mauri or Sergio Cuenca Asensi.
